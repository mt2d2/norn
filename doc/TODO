* fill in readme
* rewrite lexer/parser
	* seriously clean up Parser::parse() to fix up that two pass nonsense
	* fix style (camelCase, z.B.)
	* allow multiple statements in if
* decouple lexer from main and parser
* mismatch between types = ERRORS!
* add returns, check to see if matches right type?
